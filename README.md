### Programming Problem Notes


 - How we should compile your code (`g++` command or `make` target)
<<<<<<< HEAD
  make amazon
  ./amazon database.txt

  Everything should be good to go! 
=======


 - Design decisions you made or other non-trivial choices for your implementation


 - Any additional tests you wrote and what files those exist in


 - Known errors/anything to help us grade (though we will run automated tests,
knowing what features may be broken/missing may help us provide some partial credit)
