### Programming Problem Notes


 - How we should compile your code (`g++` command or `make` target)
  make amazon
  ./amazon database.txt

  Everything should be good to go! 


 - Known errors/anything to help us grade (though we will run automated tests,
knowing what features may be broken/missing may help us provide some partial credit)

i was getting an error pushing my files from Codio to Github. 
I ended up troubleshooting and ended up deleting util.cpp, book.h, and README.md as it 
was prompting me errors. 
The correct files are all uploaded, however, 
I want to make whomever aware that those original files were submitted for the 
checkpoint which my git push worked properly. 
Please reach out to the email above if you have any questions.
